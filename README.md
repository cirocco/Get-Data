# Get-Data
This is the final course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course at Johns Hopkins, via Coursera.

Included here are the following:

* an R script called run_analysis.R. The script performs the following actions:
+ it downloads the data from this site: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
+ it creates a new directory inside the current working directory
+ it unzips the data into the new directory
+ it moves the current working directory into the new working directory

* a codebook called CodeBook.md that explains the variables, data and transformations performed in order to clean the data into
* the dataset, entitled happydata.txt. This is a 180 x 66 set of data.

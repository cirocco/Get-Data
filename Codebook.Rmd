## Project Description
This collection represents data collected from the output of the accelerometer and gyroscope contained within a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

Overall, the data describes a broad collection of measurements. However, the script in this repository summarizes only a subset of that collection and presents it in tidy data fashion. The script makes the rest of the data available within the directory structure, in case it is needed for further summary, but does no further processing on it nor is that data included in this repository.

##Study design and data processing
Thirty (30) volunteers aged between 19-48 were individually asked to wear the phone while performing the following activities:
  * a) Walking
  * b) Walking_Upstairs
  * c) Walking_Downstairs
  * d) Sitting
  * e) Standing
  * f) Laying
Measurements were obtained via the phone's accelerometer and gyroscope for 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz, and were labeled manually using the video recorded of the subjects' performance of the activities to verify the actions.

Of the set obtained, seventy percent (70%) was randomly separated into the training data, and thirty percent (30%) were separated into the test data.

###Collection of the raw data
From the study notes: "The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain."

##Creating the tidy datafile

The script checks to see if the zip file has been downloaded and if it has been unzipped. As necessary, it unzips the zip file, or downloads and unzips it.

Next, it loads and merges the training and testing data, omitting the measurements for inertial signals as specified by the assignment. It adjusts the names of the variables for ease of reading, loads the subjects (simple integers), swaps the Activity numbers for the names of the Activities the subjects performed, combines the whole thing, summarizes the means of the standard deviation and the means of the measurements, and outputs everything to a file called "happydata.txt."

###Guide to create the tidy data file
Description on how to create the tidy data file (1. download the data, ...)/

###Cleaning of the data
The cleaning portion of this script includes the following activities. [link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail]()

##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
General description of the file including:
 - Dimensions of the dataset
 - Summary of the data
 - Variables present in the dataset

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description of what the variable describes.

Some information on the variable including:
 - Class of the variable
 - Unique values/levels of the variable
 - Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels). 

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

####Notes on variable 1:
If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.
